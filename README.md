# PIG-Game-Java-Script-Project
Developed a 2 player game played with a Dice, where the number generated           
for every die roll adds up to the score of the current player and the first player  
to reach the score of 100 wins. But if number 1 is rolled, the player score 
turns to 0 and it is the next players turn to play. The player can choose to 
Hold, which means his current score gets saved and the player can start of 
from this score for his next turn.

Technologies: Java Script, HTML, CSS
